## Development Guide
- The specifications for the application can be found in the SPEC.md file at the root of the project
- A README.md should always be up to date with the latest information about how to install and run the project
- A ARCHITECTURE.md architecture decision log should be kept up to date throughout development
- We should build everything API first. Document the API for external consumption
- Keep an architecture change log that summarizes all of the major architectural decisions that you make along the way
- Keep a README of how to deploy the application, the key features of the application.
- This should be a project tracked in Git. Commit early and often and document the changes made clearly.
- **Comprehensive test coverage is required.** All API endpoints must have integration tests. Business logic and service functions must have unit tests. Tests should be runnable without external dependencies (use in-memory databases for testing).
